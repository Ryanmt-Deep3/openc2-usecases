## About
add blah blah

The plugfest/hackathon is open to all and will be at US CYBERCOM’s “Dream Port” facility in Maryland on Jan 27-28. DreamPort is an unclassified CYBERCOM facility  to foster government/industry innovation. Advance registration is required.

## Is it Plugfest or Hackathon? BOTH!
This is both a plugfest (testing interoperability of existing implementations)
and a hackathon (writing software to meet a need).
Come prepared to participate in either or both.

## Who is attending?
Although it is not required to announce if you will be attending,
the hope is many will and include what they will be bringing to the table:
- Google - put link to new page with plugfest resources they are providing
- GitHub - put link to new page with plugfest resources they are providing
- NSA - ok to put? what bringing?
- sFractal Consulting - blah blah and link to a package
- G2 -ok to put? what bringing?
- AT&T - ok to put? what bringing?
- Broadcom/Symantec - ok to put? what bringing?

## What usecases addressed?
It is not required, but hoped, that attendees will publish use cases of interest
prior to arriving.
One of the first orders of business will be a brainstorming session
to make this list as complete as possible for meeting the attendees needs.
Immediately following will be scheduling out what to work on during the two days.

### DoD Comply to Connect
The DoD CIO and the Chief of CYBERCOM have been tasked (Public Law 114-328-DEC. 23, 2016 Sec 1653) with creating a ‘comply to connect’ policy for all DoD networked devices. They consider a software inventory (termed a Software Bill of Materials or SBOM in many industries. See http://ntia.gov/sbom) an integral part of ‘comply to connect’ since you can’t claim compliance if you don’t know what software is present.
The use case continues with various actions to be taken based on analyzing the SBoM.
See LINKHERE for more info.

### Fill-in-the-blank Comply to Connect
Fill-in-the-blank comply to connect is a set of usecases for other industries that have similar needs to the DoD use case above. The differences will be in the policy in what the 'acceptance' criteria are and what actions will be taken. The common aspect is a request for a SBoM. In some cases the acceptance criteria may be simply that one exists. In another it may be that it is complete and no known CVE's with CVSS>7 are present. Etc. The DoD use case has a set of actions to be taken that other usecases may use a subset of, or may have unique actions of it's own.

blah blah on other several healthcare usecases

include transportaton procurement scenario

include manufacturing scenario

include industrial actuator being added scenario

include ISP/CSP scenario

include sFractal home/small-business scenarios

## Oasis OpenC2 wrt Plugfest/Hackathon
blah blah on it is open to all and therefore NOT an OASIS meeting where OASIS
intellectual property sharing rules apply.
Get better wording from Chet

### OpenC2 Plugfest Planning

As discussed at the 18 September TC meeting OpenC2 has been offered the opportunity to run a plug fest hosted
by US Cyber Command in their public, unclassified DreamPort facility. TC members are encouraged to consider
participation in this event, tentatively planned for the week of 27 January 2020.

TC chair's initial request (19 Sept) for plug fest participation:

TC chair's request (25 Sept) for plug fest use cases and related information:

## Lessons Learned from Previous Plugfests
The CTI TC published lessons learned from their STIX plugfest, which
included:

**Issue:** Lack of stable/validated schema and data sets that can be used for all clients and servers

**Action:**
* Define and maintain a package of downloadable JSON schema and test data that all plugfest/interop participants can use before plugfest.
* Need common sets of data for all to use for testing.
* Need sets of data that are unique to vendors or use cases that help provide more robust testing.

This repository includes use case descriptions, schemas, and test data (good and bad) for use by participants prior to the event.

## Outcomes / Post Mortem
This section is for after the plugfest to document the outcomes relevant to
the OASIS OpenC2 TC. Reminder to review intellectual property considerations
prior to entering data here,
particularly for input from non-TC members
since they are not bound by sharing agreement.
