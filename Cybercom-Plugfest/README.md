# OpenC2 Plugfest Planning

As discussed at the 18 September TC meeting OpenC2 has been offered the opportunity to run a plug fest hosted
by US Cyber Command in their public, unclassified DreamPort facility. TC members are encouraged to consider
participation in this event, tentatively planned for the week of 27 January 2020.

A Tech Talk at DreamPort is planned for early November to provide that community information about OpenC2
and our plans for the plug fest.

## Preparation
The CTI TC published lessons learned from their STIX plugfest, which
included:

**Issue:** Lack of stable/validated schema and data sets that can be used for all clients and servers

**Action:**
* Define and maintain a package of downloadable JSON schema and test data that all plugfest/interop participants can use before plugfest.
* Need common sets of data for all to use for testing.
* Need sets of data that are unique to vendors or use cases that help provide more robust testing.

This repository includes use case descriptions, schemas, and test data (good and bad) for use by participants prior to the event.

## Plugfest Use Cases:
* A. Comply to Connect (C2C)
