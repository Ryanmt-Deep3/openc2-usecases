# Actuator Autodiscovery
This use case describes how an OpenC2 producer [[1]("endnote1)] can
identify the type and capabilities of managed devices/agents.  It assumes that communication
with a device has already been established [[2](#endnote2)].  Autodiscovery is the machine-to-machine
equivalent of a **help** facility used by human operators to discover types, versions,
supported commands/options, and other features of managed devices.

Autodiscovery (introspection) is supported in the OpenC2 Language Specification version 1.0
(working draft 9, 17 Oct 2018, submitted for public review) through use of the **query features**
command.  See Annex B for usage of the query command to determine an actuator's:
1) Supported OpenC2 Language Specification versions
2) Supported Actuator Profiles
3) Supported Targets applicable to each Action
4) Syntax of all supported OpenC2 commands and responses
5) Maximum rate of command execution
6) Actuator-specific property values

## Endnotes
 1. <a name="endnote1">A **producer**</a> is an orchestrator, management application or other entity
 that controls the operation of an **actuator**.  The producer sends OpenC2 commands and
 receives responses from the actuator.  In a client-server environment the producer acts as the client
 and the actuator acts as a server listening for incoming commands.  In symmetric communication environments
 (pub/sub, message bus, p2p, connectionless, etc) the producer is the initiator and the actuator is the
 responder.
 2. <a name="endnote1">Communication</a> requirements are specified elsewhere
