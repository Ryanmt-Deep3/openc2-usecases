# Cancel Command
## Objective
There are many usecases where a command is sent with either a duration
or delayed start.
For example, an ip or email source may be blacklisted for a day.
Or the plan is to add new capabilities at a certain time so allow commands
are sent with start time coincident with new resources.

Conditions may change that require modification or canceling a previous command.
For example it may be decided to permantently blacklist the ip or email domain.
Or it may be decided the blacklist was in error and must be cancelled.
Or maybe to change the time of the cutover to new resources and the new
time is currently unknown. 
In these cases, it is desirable to 'cancel' a command 
previously scheduled to take place in the future.

## Initial Conditions
A command was sent for execution in the future.

## Scenario
Conditions change and the command needs to be cancelled.
